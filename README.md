This is toy app to display the build of a React and Rails 7 Application

Coaches can add slots of availability to their calendars. These slots are always 2 hours long and each slot can be booked by exactly 1 student.

For example, a coach might set these times as available: 2022-02-23 10am-12pm, 2022-02-23 12pm-2pm, 2022-03-02 5pm - 7pm.

Coaches can view their own upcoming schedule.

Students can view upcoming available times across all coaches’ calls.

Students can book a slot for a call (the full 2 hours), and view their booked slots.

After they complete a call with a student, coaches will record the student’s satisfaction (an integer 1-5) and write some free-form notes.

Coaches should be able to review their past scores and notes for all of their calls.
